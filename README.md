## What is SpreadPaper?

SpreadPaper is a native macOS utility that lets you use a single high-resolution image as a wallpaper that seamlessly spans across all your connected monitors. No more dealing with separate wallpapers for each display or awkward cropping – just drag, position, and apply.

Perfect for:
- **Multi-monitor setups** with 2, 3, or more displays
- **Ultra-wide panoramic images** that deserve to be displayed in their full glory
- **Creative professionals** who want a cohesive desktop aesthetic
- **Anyone** tired of macOS's limited multi-monitor wallpaper options

## 📥 Download & Installation

**[Download the latest version](https://github.com/spreadpaper/SpreadPaper/releases/latest)**

Because SpreadPaper is a free, open-source project and not signed with a paid Apple Developer ID ($99/year), macOS Gatekeeper will flag it on the first launch. **This is normal behavior for FOSS apps.**

1. **Download** the `SpreadPaper.dmg` (or `.zip`) from the Releases page.
2. **Open** the DMG and drag **SpreadPaper** to your **Applications** folder.
3. **Right-Click** (or Control-Click) the SpreadPaper app icon in your Applications folder.
4. Select **Open** from the menu.
5. A dialog will appear saying *"SpreadPaper cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"* — Click **Open** in this dialog.

*You only need to do this once. Future launches will work normally.*

## How to Use

1. **Launch SpreadPaper** and click "Open" or drag an image onto the window
2. **Position your wallpaper** by dragging it around the preview canvas
3. **Adjust the zoom** using the slider or +/- buttons to get the perfect fit
4. **Flip if needed** to mirror your image horizontally
5. **Click "Apply Wallpaper"** to set it across all your monitors
6. **Save as preset** (optional) to quickly reapply this configuration later
