## What is SpreadPaper?

SpreadPaper is a native macOS utility that lets you use a single high-resolution image as a wallpaper that seamlessly spans across all your connected monitors. No more dealing with separate wallpapers for each display or awkward cropping – just drag, position, and apply!

Perfect for:
- **Multi-monitor setups** with 2, 3, or more displays
- **Ultra-wide panoramic images** that deserve to be displayed in their full glory
- **Creative professionals** who want a cohesive desktop aesthetic
- **Anyone** tired of macOS's limited multi-monitor wallpaper options

## Features

✨ **Visual Positioning** – Drag and position your wallpaper exactly where you want it across all displays

🎯 **Live Preview** – See exactly how your wallpaper will look before applying it

🔄 **Flip & Scale** – Flip horizontally and zoom in/out to get the perfect fit

💾 **Save Presets** – Save your favorite wallpaper configurations for quick switching

🖥️ **Multi-Monitor Smart** – Automatically detects all connected displays and their arrangement

🎨 **High Quality** – Renders at native resolution for each display with optimal quality
